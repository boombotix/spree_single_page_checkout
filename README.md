Spree Single Page Checkout
=======================

Single Page Checkout for Boombotix Spree store.

Includes
---------

- Extension of the JavaScript `Spree` object to make API calls to step through the states of the checkout process
- Geolocation via Google Maps
- Front-end Validation via jQuery.payment & jQuery.h5validate plugins


Dependencies
----------

- Spree (v.2.2.2)
- Bootstrap (`bootstrap-sass`)
- Fontawesome (`font-awesome-rails`)

Includes
----------
jquery-ui
jquery.payment
jquery.h5validate
jquery.select-to-autocomplete


Installation
------------

Add spree_single_page_checkout to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_single_page_checkout'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_single_page_checkout:install
```

Optionally, if you have guest checkout enabled, you can set
`Spree::Auth::Config[:registration_step]` to `false`
since we gather the email in the checkout.

Testing
-------

> Capybara testing via poltergeist -- you'll need PhantomJS installed on your machine.

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_single_page_checkout/factories'
```
